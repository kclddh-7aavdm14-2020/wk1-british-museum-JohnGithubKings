    <h2 id="titlesmall">Variety</h2>

        It is a website used for the storage and preservation of the most varied and disparate contents. Inside it are
        freely available and downloadable many contents such as: books, software, movies and much more in a simple and
        free way. This site supports the idea of free information and liquid culture. Personally I am very much in favor
        of this kind of initiatives and I believe that, if you respect a period of a few months from the release of the
        work, it is a correct way to circulate culture. Obviously this may bother the owners of the rights of the works
        in question, but I do not want to go into this discussion.

    <h2 id="titlesmall">Usability</h2>

    <p id="para">

        One of the features that immediately jumped out at me of this site is the fact that there are no ads or
        advertisements of any kind and that the layout is very simple and modular, designed to optimize the search and
        speed of loading pages. Probably it is preloaded html and css code and not a server that generates the pages
        every time. I could be wrong about this but probably so.
