    <p id="para">For this website I have to make a generally negative comment. I was, in fact, disappointed by many
        aspects of the site. </p>

    <h2 id="header-title">Structure of the site
    </h2>
    <p id="para">the site has in itself a poorly maintained structure that seems to be the result of some CMS like
        Wordpress used even in a hurry. There are in fact space holes already in the homepage. Moreover, much stranger,
        is the fact that the "archive" section of this web presents a totally different style from the rest of the site.
        In addition, always in this section the style is much more dated as if it were a part of the site that has not
        been updated.
    </p>
    <h2 id="header-title">Contents
    </h2>
    <p id="para">The works that the museum exhibits are available online only in a low-resolution form and without any
        possibility of interaction. In addition, the catalog is very limited and the search for objects is poorly
        managed.</p>
