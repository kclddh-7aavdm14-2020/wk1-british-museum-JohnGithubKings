    <p id="para">



        This website, unlike all the previous ones, has chosen to tell its content in a totally different way. In fact,
        the usability and navigation are totally sacrificed in favor of linearity of narration and ultra minimalist
        style. It is more like a book than a website. All this is obviously wanted by the creators of this site and in
        my opinion they did a good job. They made a different site that I was able to appreciate.
