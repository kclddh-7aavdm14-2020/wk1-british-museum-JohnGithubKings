    <h2 id="titlesmall">A different way of narrating</h2>
    <p id="para">



        This website, unlike all the previous ones, has chosen to tell its content in a totally different way. In fact,
        the usability and navigation are totally sacrificed in favor of linearity of narration and ultra minimalist
        style. It is more like a book than a website. All this is obviously wanted by the creators of this site and in
        my opinion they did a good job. They made a different site that I was able to appreciate.

    <h2 id="titlesmall">Usability</h2>

    <p id="para">

        One of the features that immediately jumped out at me of this site is the fact that there are no ads or
        advertisements of any kind and that the layout is very simple and modular, designed to optimize the search and
        speed of loading pages. Probably it is preloaded html and css code and not a server that generates the pages
        every time. I could be wrong about this but probably so.
