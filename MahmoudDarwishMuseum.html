    <p id="para">I am sorry to admit that this is the worst site I have visited in this course. It totally lacks of a digital archive that can be consulted and the things present are the shop that doesn't work and some photos of Mahmoud Darwish. There are problems with the language because every time you try to change the page the language changes from English to Arabic making it impossible to consult the site. The virtual tour at least allows you to visit a small part of the museum. there is also the 3d tour that is a non-interactive video that gives us an idea of the experience that we could visit inside it.
