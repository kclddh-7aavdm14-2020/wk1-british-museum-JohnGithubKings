    <h2 id="titlesmall">Intro</h2>
    <p id="para">
        The site was created in <strong>2007</strong> and since then has been very updated, both in content and structure. In fact, today it is possible to consult informative content and also enjoy a<strong> large
            gallery</strong> of digitized artifacts/works.
    </p>
    <h2 id="titlesmall" id="titlesmall">Structure</h2>
    <p id="para">
        Even if the appearance is chaotic, the site is <strong>well structured.</strong> It is evident that the purouse is to make the visitor<em> "get lost"</em> within it thanks to the presence of content with large and very bulky photos placed under
        the header of the site and covering multiple aspects such as events, sections of the site, or exhibitions and much more.

        <h2 id="titlesmall">Online Collection</h2>
        <p id="para">
            This is much more than just a simple site where you can make your visit reservation because it offers the possibility to consult a wide range of objects and sections of the museum itself that I will describe in the following sections.


            <h2 id="titlesmall">Virtual Tour</h2>
            <p id="para">
                The <strong>Virtual Tour </strong> was very interesting for me because I never expected <em>Google's
            technologies </em>- in particular the one used for<em> Google Street Viewer </em>- to be used to make possible the online visit the various sections of the museum. I think this is an excellent technical choice because it offers the possibility
                (to less experienced visitors of the web-site) to use an interface more familiar to navigation.

                <h2 id="titlesmall">3D Models</h2>
                <p id="para">
                    I was positively impressed by the great availability of <strong> 3D objects </strong>within the site, there are 257 of them. The technology used to visualize them is the <strong>Sketchfab technology </strong>, which I did not expect
                    it could reach such high levels of detail within web browsers; moreover the loadings are very fast.
